# Raspberry Kubernetes Cluster

## Why?


That is not a very good reason aside from get some fun. Beside this pretty much obvious, and definitely the most important, reason I must notice that in my work there are lots of distributed systems to play. So aside from the fun part it is also a nice thing to have when you must put in practice some ideas that usually run in a cluster of machines. 

### Why Raspberry

The reason for Raspberry as the bare metal solution is pretty obvious. Its **cheap**. I definitely do not have the most performant cluster in the world, not even in this block of apartments but it is enough to tinker with some cool ideas. 

### Why Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a well suported toolkit to manage the lifecycle of container applications and give us a very interesting set of features to deploy, update and scale our containers. Since it was developed by google has a very active developer community, so that's pretty much it.
